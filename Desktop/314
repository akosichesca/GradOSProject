INFO: The IO information is provided in three file formats as part of the Place and Route (PAR) process.  These formats are:
1. The <design name>_pad.txt file (this file) designed to provide information on IO usage in a human readable ASCII text format viewable through common text editors.
2. The <design namd>_pad.csv file for use with spreadsheet programs such as MS Excel. This file can also be read by PACE to communicate post PAR IO information.
3. The <design name>.pad file designed for parsing by customers.  It uses the "|" as a data field separator.
